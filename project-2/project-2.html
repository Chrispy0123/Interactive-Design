    <h1>The Fair-Haried Eckbert</h1>
    <h2>Ludwig Tieck</h2>

<div class="center">
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
In a district of the Harz dwelt a Knight, whose common designation in that quarter was the Fair-haired Eckbert. He was about forty years of age, scarcely of middle stature, and short light-coloured locks lay close and sleek round his pale and sunken countenance. He led a retired life, had never interfered in the feuds of his neighbours; indeed, beyond the outer wall of his castle he was seldom to be seen. His wife loved solitude as much as he; both seemed heartily attached to one another; only now and then they would lament that Heaven had not blessed their marriage with children.
      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
Few came to visit Eckbert; and when guests did happen to be with him, their presence made but little alteration in his customary way of life. Temperance abode in his household, and Frugality herself appeared to be the mistress of the entertainment. On these occasions Eckbert was always cheerful and lively; but when he was alone, you might observe in him a certain mild reserve, a still, retiring melancholy.
      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
His most frequent guest was Philip Walther; a man to whom he had attached himself, from having found in him a way of thinking like his own. Walther's residence was in Franconia; but he would often stay for half a year in Eckbert's neighbourhood, gathering plants and minerals, and then sorting and arranging them. He lived on a small independency, and was connected with no one. Eckbert frequently attended him in his sequestered walks; year after year a closer friendship grew betwixt them.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
There are hours in which a man feels grieved that he should have a secret from his friend, which, till then, he may have kept with niggard anxiety; some irresistible desire lays hold of our heart to open itself wholly, to disclose its inmost recesses to our friend, that so he may become our friend still more. It is in such moments that tender souls unveil themselves, and stand face to face; and at times it will happen, that the one recoils affrighted from the countenance of the other.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
It was late in Autumn, when Eckbert, one cloudy evening, was sitting, with his friend and his wife Bertha, by the parlour fire. The flame cast a red glimmer through the room, and sported on the ceiling; the night looked sullenly in through the windows, and the trees without rustled in wet coldness. Walther complained of the long road he had to travel; and Eckbert proposed to him to stay where he was, to while away half of the night in friendly talk, and then to take a bed in the house till morning. Walther agreed, and the whole was speedily arranged: by and by wine and supper were brought in; fresh wood was laid upon the fire; the talk grew livelier and more confidential.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
The cloth being removed, and the servants gone, Eckbert took his friend's hand, and said to him: "Now you must let my wife tell you the history of her youth; it is curious enough, and you should know it." "With all my heart," said Walther; and the party again drew round the hearth.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
It was now midnight; the moon looked fitfully through the breaks of the driving clouds. "You must not reckon me a babbler," began the lady. "My husband says you have so generous a mind, that it is not right in us to hide aught from you. Only do not take my narrative for a fable, however strangely it may sound.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"I was born in a little village; my father was a poor herdsman. Our circumstances were not of the best; often we knew not where to find our daily bread. But what grieved me far more than this, were the quarrels which my father and mother often had about their poverty, and the bitter reproaches they cast on one another. Of myself too, I heard nothing said but ill; they were forever telling me that I was a silly stupid child, that I could not do the simplest turn of work; and in truth I was extremely inexpert and helpless; I let things fall; I neither learned to sew nor spin; I could be of no use to my parents; only their straits I understood too well. Often I would sit in a corner, and fill my little heart with dreams, how I would help them, if I should all at once grow rich; how I would overflow them with silver and gold, and feast myself on their amazement; and then spirits came hovering up, and showed me buried treasures, or gave me little pebbles which changed into precious stones; in short, the strangest fancies occupied me, and when I had to rise and help with anything, my inexpertness was still greater, as my head was giddy with these motley visions.


      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"My father in particular was always very cross to me; he scolded me for being such a burden to the house; indeed he often used me rather cruelly, and it was very seldom that I got a friendly word from him. In this way I had struggled on to near the end of my eighth year; and now it was seriously fixed that I should begin to do or learn something. My father still maintained that it was nothing but caprice in me, or a lazy wish to pass my days in idleness: accordingly he set upon me with furious threats; and as these made no improvement, he one day gave me a most cruel chastisement, and added that the same should be repeated day after day, since I was nothing but a useless sluggard.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"That whole night I wept abundantly; I felt myself so utterly forsaken, I had such a sympathy with myself that I even longed to die. I dreaded the break of day; I knew not on earth what I was to do or try. I wished from my very heart to be clever, and could not understand how I should be worse than the other children of the place. I was on the borders of despair.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"At the dawn of day I arose, and scarcely knowing what I did, unfastened the door of our little hut. I stept upon the open field; next minute I was in a wood, where the light of the morning had yet hardly penetrated. I ran along, not looking round; for I felt no fatigue, and I still thought my father would catch me, and in his anger at my flight would beat me worse than ever.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"I had reached the other side of the forest, and the sun was risen a considerable way; I saw something dim lying before me, and a thick fog resting over it. Ere long my path began to mount, at one time I was climbing hills, at another winding among rocks; and I now guessed that I must be among the neighbouring Mountains; a thought that made me shudder in my loneliness. For, living in the plain country, I had never seen a hill; and the very word Mountains, when I heard talk of them, had been a sound of terror to my young ear. I had not the heart to go back, my fear itself drove me on; often I looked round affrighted when the breezes rustled over me among the trees, or the stroke of some distant woodman sounded far through the still morning. And when I began to meet with charcoal-men and miners, and heard their foreign way of speech, I had nearly fainted for terror.

      </p>
         </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"I passed through several villages; begging now and then, for I felt hungry and thirsty; and fashioning my answers as I best could when questions were put to me. In this manner I had wandered on&nbsp&nbsp some four days, when I came upon a little footpath, which led me farther and farther from the highway. The rocks about me now assumed a different and far stranger form. They were cliffs so piled on one another, that it looked as if the first gust of wind would hurl them all this way and that. I knew not whether to go on or stop. Till now I had slept by night in the woods, for it was the finest season of the year, or in some remote shepherd's hut; but here I saw no human dwelling at all, and could not hope to find one in this wilderness; the crags grew more and more frightful; I had many a time to glide along by the very edge of dreadful abysses; by degrees my footpath be&nbsp&nbspcame fainter, and at last all traces of it vanished from beneath me. I was utterly comfortless; I wept and screamed; and my voice came echoing back from the rocky valleys with a sound that terrified me. The night now came on, and I sought out a mossy nook to lie down in. I could not sleep; in the darkness I heard the strangest noises; sometimes I took them to proceed from wild-beasts, sometimes from wind moaning through the rocks, sometimes from unknown birds. I prayed; and did not sleep till towards morning.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"When the light came upon my face, I awoke. Before me was a steep rock; I clomb up, in the hope of discovering some outlet from the waste, perhaps of seeing houses or men. But when I reached the top, there was nothing still, so far as my eye could reach, but a wilderness of crags and precipices; &nbsp&nbspall was covered with a dim haze; the day was gray and troubled, and no tree, no meadow, not even a bush could I find, only a few shrubs shooting up stunted and solitary in the narrow clefts of the rocks. I cannot utter what a longing I felt but to see one human creature, any living mortal, even &nbsp&nbspthough I had been afraid of hurt from him. At the same time I was tortured by a gnawing hunger; I sat down, and made up my mind to die&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp. After a while, however, the desire of living gained the mastery; I roused myself, and wandered forward amid tears and broken sobs all day; in the end, I hardly knew what I was doing; I was tired and spent; I scarcely wished to live, and yet I feared to die.


      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"Towards night the country seemed to grow a little kindlier; my thoughts, my desires revived, the wish for lif&nbsp&nbsp&nbspe awoke in all my veins. I thought I heard the rushing of a mill afar off; I redoubled my steps; and how glad, how light of heart was I, when at last I actually gained the limits of the barren rocks, and saw&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp woods and meadows lying before me, with soft green hills in the distance! I felt as if I had stept out of hell into a paradise; my loneliness and helplessness no longer frightened me.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"Instead of the hoped-for mill, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">I came upon a waterfall</span>, which, &nbsp&nbsp&nbspin truth, considerably damped my joy. I was lifting a drink from it in the hollow of my hand, when all at once I thought I heard a slight cough some little way from me. Never in my life was I so joyfully surprised as at this moment: I went near, and at the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp border of the wood I saw an old woman sitting resting on the ground. She was dressed almost wholly in black; a black hood &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcovered her head, and the greater part of her face; in her hand she held a crutch.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"I came up to her, and <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">begged for help; she made me sit by her</span>, and gave me bread, and a&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp little wine. While I ate, she sang in a screeching tone some kind of spiritual song. When she had done, she told me I might follow her.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"The offer charmed me, strange as the old woman's voice and look appeared. With her crutch she limped away pretty fast, and at every step she twisted her face so oddly, that at first I was like to laugh. The <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">wild rocks retired behind us more &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand more: I never </span> shall forget the aspect and the feeling of that evening. All things were as molten into the softest&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp golden red; the trees were standing with their tops in the glow of the sunset; on the fields lay a mild brightness; the woods and the leaves of the trees were standing motionless; the pure sky looked out like an opened paradise, and the gushing of the brooks, and, from time to time, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">the rustling of the trees</span>, resounded through the serene stillness, as in pensive joy. My young soul was here first taken with a forethought of the world and its vicissitudes. I forgot myself and my conductress; my spirit and my eyes were wandering among the shining clouds.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"We now mounted an eminence planted with birch-trees; from the top we looked into a green valley, likewise <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">full of birches; and down below, in the middle </span> of them, was a little hut. A glad barking reached us, and immediately a little nimble dog &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp came springing round the old woman, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">fawned on her, and wagged its tail; </span> it next came to me, viewed me on all sides, and then turned back with a friendly&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp look to its old mistress.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"On reaching the bottom of the hill, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">I heard the strangest song, as </span> if coming from the hut,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and sung by some bird. It ran thus:

      </p>
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
  Alone in wood so gay
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
  'Tis good to stay,
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
  Morrow like today,
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
 Forever and aye:
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
  O, I do <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">love to stay</span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
 Alone in wood so gay.
</blockquote>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"These few <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">words were continually repeated, and to describe the sound, it </span> was as if&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp you heard forest-horns and shalms sounded together from a far distance.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"My <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">curiosity was wonderfully on the stretch; without waiting f&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspor the old woman's orders, </span> I stept into the hut. It was already dusk; here all was neatly swept and trimmed; some bowls were standing in a cupboard, some strange-looking casks or pots on a table; in a <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> glittering cage, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphanging by the window, was </span> a bird, and this in fact proved to be the singer. The old woman coughed and panted: it seemed as if she never would get over her fatigue: she patted the little dog, she talked with the bird, which only answered her with its accustomed song; and for me, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">she did not seem to recollect that I was there at all. Looking at her so, many qualms and fears came over me; for her face was in perpetual motion; and, besides, her head shook </span> rom old age, so that, for my life, I could not understand what sort of countenance she had.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"Having gathered strength again, she lit a candle, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">covered a very &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsmall table, </span> and brought out supper. She now looked round for me, and bade me take a little cane-chair. I was thus sitting <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> close fronting her, with the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp light between us. She </span> folded her bony hands, and prayed aloud, still twisting her countenance, so that I was once more on the point of laughing; but I took strict care that I might not make her angry.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"After supper <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">she again prayed, then showed me a bed in a low narrow closet; she herself slept in the room. I did not watch long, for I was half stupefied; but&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in the night I now and then awoke, </span> and heard the old woman coughing, and between whiles talking with her dog and her bird, which last seemed dreaming, and <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> replied with only one or two words of its &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprhyme. This, </span> with the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp birches rustling before the window, and the song of a distant nightingale, made such a wondrous combination, that <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> I never fairly thought I was awake, but </span> only falling out of &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspone dream into another still stranger.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"The old woman <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">awoke me in the morning, and soon after gave &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspme work. I was put to spin, which I now learned very easily; I had likewise to take charge of the dog and the bird. </span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I soon learned my business in the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphouse: I now felt as if it all must be so; I never once remembered that the old woman had so many singularities, that her dwelling was mysterious, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> and lay apart from all men, </span> and that the bird must be a very strange creature. Its beauty, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspindeed, always struck me, for its feathers glittered with all <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">possible colours; the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfairest deep blue, and the most burning red, alternated about his neck and body; and when </span> singing, he blew himself proudly out, so that his feathers looked still finer.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
"My old mistress &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoften went abroad, and did not come again till night; on these occasions I went out to meet her with the dog, and <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">she used to call me child and daughter. In the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end I grew to like her heartily; as our mind, especially in childhood, will become accustomed and attached to anything. </span> In the evenings, she taught me to read; and this was <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> afterwards a source of boundless satisfaction to me in my solitude, for &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshe had </span> several ancient-written books, that contained the strangest &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstories.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
<span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> "The recollection of the life I then led is still singular to me: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVisited by no human creature, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsecluded in the circle of so small a family; for the dog and the bird made the same impression on me </span> which in other cases &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplong-known friends produce. I am surprised <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> that I have never&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp since been able to recall the dog's name, a very odd one, often as I then </span> pronounced it.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
<span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">"Four years I had passed in this way (I must now have been nearly twelve), when my old dame began to put more trust in me, and at length told me a secret. The &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbird, I found, laid every day an egg, in which there was a pearl or a jewel. I had already noticed that she &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoften went to fettle privately about the cage, but I had never troubled myself farther on the subject. She now gave </span> me charge of &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgathering these eggs in her absence, and carefully storing<span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> them up in the strange-looking pots. She would </span> leave me food, and sometimes &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstay away longer, for weeks, for months. My little wheel kept humming round, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> the dog barked, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe bird sang; and withal there was such a stillness in the neighbourhood, that I do not recollect of any storm or foul&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp weather all the time I stayed&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp there. No one wandered thither; no wild-beast came </span> near our dwelling: I was satisfied, and worked along in peace from day to day. <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> One would perhaps be very happy, could he pass his life so undisturbedly to the end. </span>


      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
<span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> "From the little that I read, I formed quite marvellous notions &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof the world and its people; all taken from myself and my society. When I read of witty persons, I could not figure them but&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp like the little shock; great ladies, I conceived, were like the bird; all old women like my mistress. </span> I had &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspread somewhat of love, too; and often, in fancy, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">I would&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sport strange stories with myself. I figured out the fairest knight on Earth; adorned him with all perfections, without knowing rightly,</span> after all&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp my labour, how he looked: but I could feel a hearty pity for myself when he ceased to love me; <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwould then, in thought, make long melting speeches, or perhaps aloud, to try if I could win him back. You smile! These young </span> days are, in truth, far away from us all.
      </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"I now liked&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp better to be left alone, for&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was then sole mistress of the house. The dog loved me, and did <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">all I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwanted; the bird replied to all my </span> questions with his rhyme; my wheel kept briskly turning, and&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp at bottom I had never any wish for change. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen my dame returned from her long wanderings, she would praise my diligence; she said her house, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsince I belonged to it, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">was managed far more perfectly; she took a pleasure</span> in my &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrowth and healthy looks; in short, she&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp treated me in all points like her daughter.

      </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"'Thou art&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a good girl, child,' said she&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp once to me, in her creaking tone; 'if thou continuest so, it will be well <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">with&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp thee: but none ever prospers when he </span> leaves the straight path; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppunishment will overtake him, though it may be late.' I gave little&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp heed to this remark of hers at the time, for in all my temper and movements&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was very lively; but by night it occurred to me again, and I could not understand what she meant by it. I considered all the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">words attentively; I had </span> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspread of riches, and at last it struck me that her pearls and jewels might perhaps be something precious. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEre long this thought grew clearer to me. But the straight path, and leaving it? What could she mean by this?

      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"I was now fourteen; it &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspis the misery of man that he arrives at understanding through the loss of innocence. I now <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"> saw well enough &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat it lay with me to </span> take the jewels and the bird in the old woman's&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp absence, and go forth&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with them and see the world which I had read of. Perhaps, too, it would then be possible that I might meet that fairest of all knights, who &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspforever dwelt in my memory.

      </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"At first this &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthought was nothing&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp more than any other thought; but when I used to be &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsitting at my wheel, it still returned to me, against my will; and I sometimes followed it so far, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat I already saw myself adorned in <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">splendid attire</span>, with princes and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspknights around me. On awakening&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp from these dreams, I would feel a sadness when I looked up, and found &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmyself still in the little cottage. For the rest, if I went through my duties, the old woman troubled herself little about what I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthought or felt.
      </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"One day &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshe went out again, telling me that she should be away on this occasion longer than usual; that I must take strict charge of everything, and not let the time hang heavy on my hands. I had a sort of fear on taking&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp leave of her, for I felt as if I should not see her any &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmore. I looked long after her, and knew not why I felt so sad; it was almost as if my purpose had already stood before me, without myself being conscious of it.
      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"Never did I tend the dog and the bird with such diligence as now; they were nearer to my heart than formerly. The old <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">woman had been gone some days, when </span> I rose &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspone morning in the firm mind to leave the cottage, and set out with the bird to see this world they talked so much of. I felt pressed and hampered in my heart; I wished&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to stay where I was, and yet the thought of that afflicted me; there was a strange contention in my soul, as if between two discordant spirits. One moment my peaceful solitude would seem to me so beautiful; the next the image of a new world, with its many wonders, would again enchant me.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"I knew not what&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to make of it; the dog leaped up continually about me; the sunshine spread abroad over the fields; the green birch-trees glittered; I always felt as &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif I had something I must do in haste; so I caught the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplittle dog, tied him up in the room, and took the cage with the bird under my arm. The dog writhed and whined at this unusual &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptreatment; he looked at me with&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp begging eyes, but I feared to have him with me. I also took one pot of jewels, and concealed it by me; the rest I left.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"The bird turned &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspits head very strangely when <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"> I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcrossed the </span> threshold; the dog tugged at his cord to follow me, but he &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas forced to stay.

      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"I did &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnot take the road to the wild rocks, but went in the opposite direction. The dog still whined and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbarked, and it touched me to the heart to hear him; the bird tried once or &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptwice to sing; but as I was carrying him, the shaking put him out.

      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"The farther &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI went, the fainter grew the barking, and at last it altogether ceased. I wept, and had almost&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp turned back, but the longing to see something new still hindered me.

      </p>

"I had got &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspacross the hills, and through some forests, when the night came on, and I was forced &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto turn aside into a village. I blushed <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">exceedingly on </span> entering the inn; they showed me to a room and bed; I slept pretty quietly, only that I dreamed of the old woman, and her &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthreatening me.

"My journey had not much variety; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe farther I went, the more was I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspafflicted by the recollection of my old mistress and the little dog; I considered that in all&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp likelihood the poor shock would die of hunger, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoften in the woods I thought my dame would suddenly meet me. Thus amid tears and sobs I went &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspalong; <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">when I stopped </span> to rest, and put the cage on the ground, the bird struck up his song, and brought&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp but too keenly to my mind the fair habitation I had left. As human nature is forgetful, I imagined that my former journey, in my childhood, had not been so sad and woful as the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppresent; I wished to be as I was then.

"I had &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsold some jewels; and now, after wandering on for several days, I reached a village. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt the very entrance I was struck with &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsomething strange; I felt terrified and knew not why; but I soon bethought &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmyself, for it was the village where I was born! How amazed &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas I! How the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp tears ran down my cheeks for gladness, for a thousand&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp singular remembrances! Many things were changed: new houses had been built, some just raised when I went away, were &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnow fallen, and had marks of fire on them; everything was far &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsmaller and more confined than I had fancied. It rejoiced my very heart that I should &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsee my parents once more after such&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp an absence. I found their little cottage, the well-known threshold; the door-latch &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas standing as of old; it &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspseemed to me as if I had shut it only yesternight. My heart beat violently, I hastily lifted that latch; but faces I had never seen before looked up and gazed at me. I asked for the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshepherd Martin; they told me that his wife and he were dead three years ago. I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdrew back quickly, and left the village weeping aloud.

    <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"I had &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfigured out so &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeautifully how I would surprise them with my riches: by the strangest chance, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhat I had only dreamed in&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp childhood was become reality; and now it was all in vain, they could not rejoice with me, and that which had been my first&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp hope in life was lost forever.

"In a &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppleasant town I hired a small house and garden, and took to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmyself a maid. The world, in truth, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspproved not so wonderful as &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI had painted it: but I forgot the old woman and my former way of life rather more, and, on the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp whole, I was contented.

"For a long&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp while the bird had ceased to sing; I was therefore not a little frightened, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhen one night he suddenly began again, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith a different rhyme. He sang:

"Throughout &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe night I could not close an eye; all things again occurred to my remembrance; and I felt, more than ever, that I had not acted rightly. When &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI rose, the aspect of the bird distressed &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspme greatly; he looked at me &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcontinually, and his&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp presence did me ill. There was now no end to his song; he sang it louder and more shrilly than he had been wont. The more I looked at him, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe more he pained and frightened me; at last I opened the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcage, put in my hand, and grasped his neck; I squeezed my &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfingers hard together, he looked at me, I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspslackened them; but he was dead. I buried him in the garden.

   <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"After&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp this, there often came a fear over me for my maid; I looked back upon myself, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfancied she might rob &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspme or murder me. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor a long while I had been acquainted with a young knight, whom I altogether liked: I bestowed on him my hand; and with this, Sir Walther, ends &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmy story."

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"Ay, you &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshould have seen her&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp then," said Eckbert warmly; "seen her youth, her &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsploveliness, and what a &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcharm her lonely way of life had given her. I had&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp no fortune; it was through her love these riches came to me; we moved hither, and our &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmarriage has at no time &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbrought us anything but good."

      </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
"But with &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspour tattling," added Bertha,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "it is &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrowing very late; we must go to sleep."
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
She rose, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspproceeded to her chamber; Walther, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith a kiss of her hand, wished her good-night,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp saying: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Many thanks, noble lady; I can well figure you beside your singing bird, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphow you fed poor little Strohmian."

      </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
Walther &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplikewise went to sleep;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Eckbert alone still &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwalked in a restless humour up and down the room. "Are not men fools?" said he at last: "I myself &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoccasioned this recital of my wife's history, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand now such confidence appears to me improper! &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWill he not abuse it? Will he not communicate the secret to others? Will he &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnot, for such is human nature, cast unblessed thoughts on our jewels, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand form pretexts and lay plans to get possession of them?"

      </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
It now &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoccurred to his mind that Walther had not &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptaken leave of him so cordially as &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmight have been expected &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspafter such a mark &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof trust: the soul once &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspset upon suspicion finds in every trifle something &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto confirm it. Eckbert, on the other hand, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreproached himself for such &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspignoble feelings to his worthy friend;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp yet still he could not cast them out. All night he plagued &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphimself with such uneasy thoughts, and got very little sleep.

      </p>
     <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
Bertha &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas unwell next day, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand could not &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcome to breakfast; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWalther did not seem to trouble himself much about her illness, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbut left her husband&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp also rather coolly. Eckbert could not comprehend such conduct; he went to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsee his wife, and found&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp her in a feverish state; she said her last night's story must have &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspagitated her.

      </p>
     <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
From that day, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWalther visited the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcastle of his friend but seldom; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand when he did appear, it was but to say a few &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspunmeaning words &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand then &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdepart. Eckbert was &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspexceedingly distressed by this demeanour: to Bertha or&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Walther he indeed said nothing of it; but to any&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp person his &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspinternal disquietude was visible enough.

      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
Bertha's sickness &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwore an aspect more &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand more serious; the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDoctor grew alarmed; the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspred had vanished from his &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppatient's cheeks, and her&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp eyes were becoming&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp more and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmore inflamed. One &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmorning she &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsent &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfor her husband to her &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbedside; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe nurses &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwere ordered to withdraw.

"Dear Eckbert," &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshe began, "I must &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdisclose a secret to thee,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp which has &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspalmost taken away&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp my senses, which&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp is &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspruining my health, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspunimportant &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptrifle as it &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmay appear. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThou mayest&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp remember, often as &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI talked of&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp my childhood,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I could &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnever &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcall to m&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspind &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe name of the dog that &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspso long beside me: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnow, that &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnight on&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp taking&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp leave, Walther all&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp at once said to me: 'I can well figure you, and how you fed poor little&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Strohmian&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.' Is it &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchance? Did he guess the name; did he know it, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand speak it &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspon purpose? If so, how stands this man connected &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith my destiny? At times I struggle with myself, as if I but imagined this mysterious business; but, alas! it is certain&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp, too certain.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I felt a&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp shudder that a stranger should help me to recall&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the memory of&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp my secrets&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp. What sayest thou, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEckbert?"


      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC">
Eckbert looked at his&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sick and agitated wife &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith deep emotion; he stood silent&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and thoughtful; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthen spoke&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp some words of comfort to her, and w&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspent out. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn a distant &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchamber, he walked to&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and fro &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin indescribable disquiet. Walther, for many&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp years, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphad been &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphis sole companion; and now this &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspperson was the only &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmortal in &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe world&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp whose existence &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppained and oppressed him. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt seemed a&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsps if he should be gay and light of heart, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwere that &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspone thing but removed. He took his bow, to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdissipate these thoughts; and went to hunt.

It was a rough stormy&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp winter-day; the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsnow &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplying deep on the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphills, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand bending&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp down the branches of the trees.

For a great while after this occurrence, Eckbert lived in the deepest solitude: he had all along been melancholy, for the strange history of his wife disturbed him, and he dreaded some unlucky incident or other; but at present he was utterly at variance with himself. The murder of his friend arose incessantly before his mind; he lived in the anguish of continual remorse.
      </p>
         </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
To dissipate his feelings, he occasionally moved to the neighbouring town, where he mingled in society &nbsp&nbsp&nbspand its amusements. He longed for a friend to fill the void in his soul; and yet, when he remembered Walther, he would shudder at the thought of meeting with a friend; for he felt convinced that, with any friend, he must be unhappy. He had lived so long with his Bertha in &nbsp&nbsp&nbsplovely calmness; the friendship of Walther had cheered him through so many years; and now both of them were suddenly swept away. As he thought of these things, there were many moments when his life appeared to him some fabulous tale, rather than the actual history of a living man.

A young knight, named Hugo, made advances to the silent melancholy Eckbert, and appeared to have a true affection&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp for him. Eckbert felt himself exceedingly surprised; he met the knight's friendship with the greater readiness, the less he had anticipated it. The two were now frequently together; Hugo showed his&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp friend all possible attentions; one scarcely ever went to ride without the other; in all companies they got together. In a word, they seemed inseparable.

      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">
Eckbert &nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas never <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">happy longer than a few transitory </span> moments: for he felt too clearly that Hugo loved him only by mistake; that he knew him not, was unacquainted with his history; and he was seized again with &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe same old longing to &nbsp&nbsp&nbspunbosom himself wholly, that he might be sure whether Hugo was his friend or not. But again his apprehensions, and the fear of being hated and abhorred, withheld him. There were many hours in which he felt so much impressed with <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">his entire worthlessness, that </span> he believed no mortal not a stranger to his history, could entertain regard for him. Yet still he was unable&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to withstand himself: on a solitary ride, he disclosed his &nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhole history to Hugo, and asked if he could love a murderer. Hugo seemed touched, and tried to comfort him. Eckbert returned to town with a lighter heart.

But it &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspseemed to be his doom that, in the very hour of confidence, he should always find materials for suspicion. <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">Scarcely had they entered the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic hall, when, in the glitter of the many </span> lights, Hugo's looks had ceased to satisfy him. He thought he noticed a malicious smile;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp he remarked that Hugo did not speak to him as usual; that he talked with the rest, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspseemed to pay no heed to him. In the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspparty was an old knight, who had always shown himself the <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">enemy of Eckbert, had often asked about his riches and his wife in a peculiar style.</span> With this&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp man Hugo was conversing; they were speaking privately, and casting looks at Eckbert. The suspicions of the latter seemed&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp confirmed; he thought himself betrayed, and a tremendous&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp rage took hold of him. As he<span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> continued gazing, on a sudden he discerned the countenance of Walther, all</span> his features, all the form so well known to him; he gazed, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand looked, and felt convinced that it was &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnone but Walther who was talking to the knight. His horror cannot be described; in a state of frenzy he rushed&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp out of the hall, left the town overnight, and after many wanderings, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturned to his castle.

Here, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplike an unquiet &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspspirit, <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">he hurried to and fro from&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp room to room; no thought &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwould stay with him; </span> out of one frightful idea he fell into another still more frightful, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand sleep never visited his eyes. Often he believed &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat he was mad, that a disturbed&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp imagination was the origin of all this terror; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthen, again, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphe recollected Walther's features,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and the whole grew <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC">more&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and more a riddle to&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp him. He resolved&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to take a journey, that he might reduce his &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthoughts to order; the hope of</span> friendship, the desire of social intercourse, he had now forever given up.

He set out, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwithout <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> prescribing to&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp himself any certain route; indeed, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphe took small heed of the country he was passing&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp through. Having&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp hastened on some days at the quickest pace&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of his &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphorse, he, on a sudden, found himself &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspentangled in a labyrinth&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of rocks, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfrom which he </span> could discover no outlet. At length he met&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp an old peasant,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp who took him by a path leading past a waterfall: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphe offered him some&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp coins for his guidance, but the peasant would&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp not have them. "What use is it?" said Eckbert. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"I could believe that this man, too, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwas none but Walther." He <span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> looked round once more, and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit was none but Walther. Eckbert spurred his horse as fast as it could gallop, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspover meads and forests, till it sank exhausted to the earth. Regardless of this, he</span> hastened forward &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspon foot.

<span style="font-family:'Bradley Hand ITC"> In &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa dreamy mood he mounted a hill: he fancied he caught the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsound of lively barking&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp at a little distance; the birch-trees </span> whispered in the intervals, and in the strangest &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnotes he heard this song:
