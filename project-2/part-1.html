This text was written to be very descriptive, filled with many adjectives. In particular, lots of color descriptions are used which I can mimic with the color of the typefaces I use. Many words like “bold” are also used so that I can change the type of words accordingly.
  This old fairy tale reminds me of medieval times and I can use background music from that time period to accompany it.
  I want to make an emphasis on these descriptions on my website so that the readers know that this is a very descriptive piece of writing. I would also like to get across that this take place in medieval times with accompanying music
