<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this park there are countless attractions that tourists love to experience. They find joy from being driven at high speeds and achieving near death experiences, often being driven just feet away from support beams that would surely cause death if collided with.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One attraction drops guests in a free fall from a tower almost 200 feet in the air. Another is inside a baobab tree where termites and other dangerous insects roam. Almost every guest is stung in the back by countless bees while inside yet they continue to go back.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 2018, 40-50 people have died in this park, often due to these unsafe conditions.
