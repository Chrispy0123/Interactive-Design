<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The park is owned by a company who has created lots of cartoons depicting many races in derogatory and stereotypical ways. Usually African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans are portrayed in very offensive ways.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One attraction is even based on their many racist cartoons. It is known to have depicted African Americans in a very stereotypical way and even glorifying the plantations that they were slaves on. Another attraction has animatronics that depict Native Americans as savage killers, holding many decapitated heads. The fact that so many children are exposed to these ideas is disgusting and we need to stop this if we ever want to develop.
