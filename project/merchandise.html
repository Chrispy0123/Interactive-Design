<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many inappropriate collectibles that the park sells is their collectable mouse heads. Very realistic replicas that depict giant-mutated, decapitated mouse heads are sought out by many children and worn by entire families. Hundreds if not thousands of variations of these monstrosities exist and consumers are encouraged to collect them all.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every vendor in this park sells mouse related products, giving off the impression that these creatures are pure and loveable. This is giving a false impression as these creatures are filthy and carry many diseases and therefore should not be approached, especially by children.
