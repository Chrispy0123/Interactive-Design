<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a far away land, one which extends beyond time, one with a castle and princesses. Filled with mice who the tourists seek out to take pictures with. The mice are not the only animals that roam the area, there are ducks, dogs, bunnies, foxes, bears and almost every animal imaginable as well as an alien roaming the park like an ungated zoo. There are no safety protocols or barriers that protect you from these wild animals yet tourists always walk up to them like they are best friends.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with these barbaric qualities the park is known to be very technologically advanced. Families often save up money for years just to visit this place once in their lifetime.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long lasting tradition for the tourists to collect decapitated mouse heads. They often wear the rotting flesh on top of their heads and carry on with their day like everything is normal. Some elite collectors try to get different variations and colors of mouse heads as they find each one to be unique in their own way.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every night hundreds of explosives are detonated in the park just for the fun of it. If any tourist were to somehow get near these when they are set off, they would almost definitely die.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this sound like a place you would want to spend thousands of dollars at just to bring your family once? I didnâ€™t think so. The fact that this park is still so successful even with all these traditions and aspects still happening is disgusting and there needs to be change.
