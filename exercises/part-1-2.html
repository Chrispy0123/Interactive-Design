<p>This is a far away land, one which extends beyond time, one with a castle and princesses. Filled with mice who the tourists seek out to take pictures with. The mice are not the only animals that roam the area, there are ducks, dogs, bunnies, foxes, bears and almost every animal imaginable as well as an alien roaming the park like an ungated zoo. There are no safety protocols or barriers that protect you from these wild animals yet tourists always walk up to them like they are best friends.
Even with these barbaric qualities the park is known to be very magical and technologically advanced. Families often save up money for years just to visit this place once in their lifetime.
Multiple people have died in this park over the years yet the park never suffers in attendance numbers due to it.
