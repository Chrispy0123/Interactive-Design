  I found this reading to be very interesting. Although I did not understand everything that the article was talking about, what I did understand definitely stuck with me.
  I have always understood that digital art is a lot different and takes different skills than physical, tangible art does. However, I never really thought about how digital art could be interpreted as mathematics or coding. At first glance nobody would ever think this but the way that the article broke down the two to show how blurry the difference between the two are was very interesting.
  After taking this class, I appreciate Jodiâ€™s work as art whereas before I would have seen it as programming. This shows how experience and perspective changes the way everyone views art (or does not view art).
