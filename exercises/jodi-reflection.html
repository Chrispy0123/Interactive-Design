  I found this reading to be very <b>interesting</b>. Although I did not understand everything that the article was talking about, what I did understand definitely stuck with me.
  I have always understood that <ins>digital art</ins> is a lot different and takes different skills than physical, <ins>tangible art</ins> does. However, I never really thought about how <ins>digital art</ins> could be interpreted as <ins>mathematics</ins> or coding. At first glance nobody would ever think this but the way that the article broke down the two to show how blurry the difference between the two are was very <b>interesting</b>.
  After taking this class, I appreciate Jodiâ€™s work as <ins> art</ins> whereas before I would have seen it as <ins>programming</ins>. This shows how <b>experience and perspective</b> changes the way everyone views art (or does not view art).
