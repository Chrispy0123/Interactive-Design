            This reading used a lot of terminology and concepts that I was not
            very familiar with, which made it difficult to understand everything
            that the author was trying to say. However, what I did understand
            was very interesting.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            First off, I was amazed to learn about how internet terminology is
            based on our household: home page, windows, etc. I can not believe
            that I did not realize this sooner. In my opinion, this shows how we
            try to make new and confusing things more understandable and
            relatable by correlating it to things that we already know.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also found it very interesting how the author viewed a blank
            window as his artspace, similar to how a painter would view a canvas
            as theris. I think that this concept is very important to understand
            when realizing that internet art and websites are a new, emerging,
            and diverse form of art.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also did not know that augmented reality was a thing back in 2017
            when this article was written. I had always assumed that it was a
            newer concept that deals with virtual reality headsets with built in
            cameras. However I am now wondering if there is more to augmented
            reality than that as it seems like it was an established art form
            already. I wonder if Pokemon Go or Snapchat filters are a type of
            augmented reality. I am now curious to research what are more common
            examples of augmented reality.

            I found the beginning of this reading very fascinating. Although it
            had almost no relevance to art or interactive design, it was a neat
            concept that definitely caught my, the reader’s, attention. It was a
            very effective hook as I never really thought about what people in
            prehistoric times did in their free time. Ursula did a great way of
            relating this story to ourselves now with the fact that we all care
            about sharing our stories and experiences more than our actual
            successes. That is especially true for me as I love to share my
            funny stories with people to make them laugh, it makes me feel good.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            Although I enjoyed the reading, I kept waiting for the transition to
            talking about a topic more relevant to our class, such as art. I am
            not quite sure how much I will use the content discussed in my art
            career but there were definitely interesting topics discussed that I
            will continue to think about in my free time.

            The discussion about the importance and fascination of heroes in our
            society was very interesting. It feels like this is ever more
            present now than ever before with the huge success of superhero
            blockbuster movies. The stories about heroes are so influential that
            there is a student who dresses up like Spider-Man and roams around
            our college campus!

            I really appreciated how to-the-point this article was. A lot of
            readings we had to do were extra long for no particular reason other
            than being wordy. This reading said what it needed to say very
            effectively.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I found it very interesting reading about different artist’s
            opinions and perspectives. It really shows how everyone is unique
            and thinks about art differently. I also had no idea what a fluxus
            artist was until I read this article so it did a great job of
            teaching me that. It is a very funny word that does not seem real,
            but that aspect is what is going to help me remember it.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            It is interesting to think about how on the surface music and
            websites do not have much in common with each other. It really shows
            how broad the term ‘art’ is. However when you break them both down
            to their core, they both require a lot of thought and creativity, as
            well as talent, to create. Just like how no two songs are the same,
            no two websites will be either. Every artist has their own distinct
            style and way of interpreting art.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I enjoyed the pictures that accompanied the corresponding text and
            paragraphs, it made it more visually appealing to read. However, I
            do not think I will retain a lot of this information. I can’t see
            how applicable any of it will be to my artistic career.
