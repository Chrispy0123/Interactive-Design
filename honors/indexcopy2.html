            This reading used a lot of terminology and concepts that I was not
            very familiar with, which made it difficult to understand everything
            that the author was trying to say. However, what I did understand
            was very interesting.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            First off, I was amazed to learn about how internet terminology is
            based on our household: home page, windows, etc. I can not believe
            that I did not realize this sooner. In my opinion, this shows how we
            try to make new and confusing things more understandable and
            relatable by correlating it to things that we already know.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also found it very interesting how the author viewed a blank
            window as his artspace, similar to how a painter would view a canvas
            as theris. I think that this concept is very important to understand
            when realizing that internet art and websites are a new, emerging,
            and diverse form of art.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also did not know that augmented reality was a thing back in 2017
            when this article was written. I had always assumed that it was a
            newer concept that deals with virtual reality headsets with built in
            cameras. However I am now wondering if there is more to augmented
            reality than that as it seems like it was an established art form
            already. I wonder if Pokemon Go or Snapchat filters are a type of
            augmented reality. I am now curious to research what are more common
            examples of augmented reality.

              I have taken many classes both with video editing and animation
              and I enjoy using both in personal projects. I would like to think
              that I know more than the average person when it comes to these
              things but I can not believe that I did not know such a simple
              concept of distinction.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              I never took the time to think about it too deeply but I had
              always assumed that transitions were always animations, when that
              is not actually the case.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              From a website standpoint, I found this layout to be very
              engaging. I appreciated the headlines that made it easier to
              comprehend what the information was about. I also really like the
              interactive animations and icons throughout that help visualize
              what is being said. I tend to find it hard to pay attention when
              reading but this layout kept my attention very well.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              I also really enjoyed watching the simplistic animations. The
              artist chose very good colors and shapes that I found engaging.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              I am interested in learning more about transition and animation
              coding when it comes to websites and perhaps I will incorporate it
              into one of my projects.

          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I find it fascinating that up until recently typography was not very
            accessible on websites. That is a concept that is hard for me to
            understand, up until now fonts on websites seemed like something
            very simple. I am amazed by how much work and progress has gone into
            making fonts more accessible and easier to use on websites.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I wonder what this class would have been like before different fonts
            were universally used. It seems like coding would be a lot more
            limited with how you can make a website unique.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            It is hard for me to comprehend there being a “first website” as
            well as someone discovering URLs. How did people access that website
            if URLs were not commonly known or implemented in computers?
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            The most interesting part of this article for me was that it used to
            be someone’s job to make fonts into images so that they can be seen
            across platforms. These people clearly did their jobs very well as
            this happened until around 2010 and I was never aware of it nor have
            I heard anyone discuss it before. It was also very innovative how
            they hid actual text behind the images so that it could still be
            searchable and selectable.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also found it very interesting how web designers do not have the
            luxor that other designers and artists have by knowing how the
            audience will see their work. It must be very stressful to not know
            what dimensions the art will be viewed on any device. These are
            concepts that I had never thought of before taking this class and I
            find it very interesting.

          This reading was definitely longer than the previous ones have been
          and there was no color involved in it either. These aspects,
          especially from an artistic point of view, made it harder for me to
          keep interest and attention to it.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
          I always find it very fascinating, yet hard to comprehend, learning
          about the beginning of the internet. Perhaps it is because I can not
          remember a time without having access to it. It has clearly become a
          very important part of our lives very quickly.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
          This also goes to show how we take the internet for granted. As
          discussed in the reading, so many different people and companies have
          made countless contributions to making the internet what it is today
          yet nobody seems to talk about it. I would say that this is a very
          important part of our history and this should be taught to more people
          so it is not lost.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
          I also found it interesting to learn about antialiasing. This is a
          word that I have heard before but did not ever think about what it
          was. I have noticed how oftentimes text online is pixelated and kind
          of blurred into the background, even with programs like photoshop. Now
          I will always notice this and think about this article. As shown in
          the picture, it definitely does make letters look smoother while
          occupying roughly the same amount of pixels.
