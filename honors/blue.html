              I have taken many classes both with video editing and animation
              and I enjoy using both in personal projects. I would like to think
              that I know more than the average person when it comes to these
              things but I can not believe that I did not know such a simple
              concept of distinction.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              I never took the time to think about it too deeply but I had
              always assumed that transitions were always animations, when that
              is not actually the case.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              From a website standpoint, I found this layout to be very
              engaging. I appreciated the headlines that made it easier to
              comprehend what the information was about. I also really like the
              interactive animations and icons throughout that help visualize
              what is being said. I tend to find it hard to pay attention when
              reading but this layout kept my attention very well.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              I also really enjoyed watching the simplistic animations. The
              artist chose very good colors and shapes that I found engaging.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
              I am interested in learning more about transition and animation
              coding when it comes to websites and perhaps I will incorporate it
              into one of my projects.

          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I find it fascinating that up until recently typography was not very
            accessible on websites. That is a concept that is hard for me to
            understand, up until now fonts on websites seemed like something
            very simple. I am amazed by how much work and progress has gone into
            making fonts more accessible and easier to use on websites.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I wonder what this class would have been like before different fonts
            were universally used. It seems like coding would be a lot more
            limited with how you can make a website unique.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            It is hard for me to comprehend there being a “first website” as
            well as someone discovering URLs. How did people access that website
            if URLs were not commonly known or implemented in computers?
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            The most interesting part of this article for me was that it used to
            be someone’s job to make fonts into images so that they can be seen
            across platforms. These people clearly did their jobs very well as
            this happened until around 2010 and I was never aware of it nor have
            I heard anyone discuss it before. It was also very innovative how
            they hid actual text behind the images so that it could still be
            searchable and selectable.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also found it very interesting how web designers do not have the
            luxor that other designers and artists have by knowing how the
            audience will see their work. It must be very stressful to not know
            what dimensions the art will be viewed on any device. These are
            concepts that I had never thought of before taking this class and I
            find it very interesting.

            This reading was definitely longer than the previous ones have been
            and there was no color involved in it either. These aspects,
            especially from an artistic point of view, made it harder for me to
            keep interest and attention to it.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I always find it very fascinating, yet hard to comprehend, learning
            about the beginning of the internet. Perhaps it is because I can not
            remember a time without having access to it. It has clearly become a
            very important part of our lives very quickly.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            This also goes to show how we take the internet for granted. As
            discussed in the reading, so many different people and companies
            have made countless contributions to making the internet what it is
            today yet nobody seems to talk about it. I would say that this is a
            very important part of our history and this should be taught to more
            people so it is not lost.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I also found it interesting to learn about antialiasing. This is a
            word that I have heard before but did not ever think about what it
            was. I have noticed how oftentimes text online is pixelated and kind
            of blurred into the background, even with programs like photoshop.
            Now I will always notice this and think about this article. As shown
            in the picture, it definitely does make letters look smoother while
            occupying roughly the same amount of pixels.

            Right off the bat I really enjoyed looking at the design of this
            reading. The rainbow color scheme as well as the use of different
            fonts and different sections of text made it very visually pleasing
            to look at. It kept my attention a lot longer than just plain text
            would have.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            When I was reading the article, I found myself playing around with
            my computer mouse. I was testing the subconscious mental connection
            that I was unaware that I had with it. I never realize how just like
            the article says, I reach for the mouse without even looking at it
            and then control it perfectly with my mind without even thinking
            about it. It is as if it is an extension of my body.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            I wonder how strange it must have been for people once the mouse was
            first invented. Was it hard to create this subconscious connection?
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            My favorite lines from this article were when Mark was describing
            the connection between our hand and the computer mouse. He said that
            “both [the] part of my body and part of the computer, binding two
            organisms into one … to simply attach a thin wire to the hand,
            linking our organic and inorganic circuits.” These descriptions were
            so vivid that I felt my hand tingle, as if it was actually
            connecting itself to my computer. The writing was so beautiful in
            this article.

            At first I was wondering why I was reading a story about the
            components of making a house. Although confused, Jeremy was able to
            make even what I would consider something very boriging regularly,
            sound and look very exciting to read about. He was able to do this
            through his wording as well as formatting and iconography that
            accompanied each other very well.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            Jeremy then flawlessly transitioned from houses to websites by
            relating the components to each other. This comparison was really
            mind opening and not only made me just look at how houses are made
            differently, but also how websites are made (coded)! As I am putting
            the final touches on my blog I will without a doubt think of it like
            building a house.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            Jeremy also then went on to talk about even more real life examples
            that he relates to websites. He was able to successfully change the
            way that I look at and think about websites (in a good way). I love
            when someone is able to change my perception on something art
            related so I can better understand and appreciate other people’s
            work.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            One bit of reception that I noticed was when Jeremy talked about how
            designers worry about their websites looking different for everyone.
            This is something that has already been discussed a lot in the
            majority of our readings.

          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            By far my favorite part about this article is the title page at the
            top, I am absolutely in love with the design of it. The use of
            different font size and type is genius and very unique from what you
            would usually find in a reading. The flickering cursor bar at the
            end of the title is very smart and gives off the impression that
            this is actually a line of text that someone is in the middle of
            coding.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            What I like even more than this is the background, not only in the
            title page, but the entire article. It uses very vibrant colors with
            lots of variations of squares that are very reminiscent of old retro
            arcade games. I feel like this is very appropriate as I tend to link
            the two in my head.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            The best part of the background is how the more you scroll and the
            longer you read the text, the more the background changes. This
            keeps everything new and prevents the website from getting visually
            boring. It actually motivated me to keep reading.
          </p>
          <p style="width: 95%; margin: auto">
            The text itself is very long and lengthy. If it weren't for the many
            pictures and colorful background, this would be somewhat of a chore
            to read.
