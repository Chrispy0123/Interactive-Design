Rethinking Digitalization: The Poetics of Browser Space

  <p>
    This reading used a lot of terminology and concepts that I was not very familiar with, which made it difficult to understand everything that the author was trying to say. However, what I did understand was very interesting.
  First off, I was amazed to learn about how internet terminology is based on our household: home page, windows, etc. I can not believe that I did not realize this sooner. In my opinion, this shows how we try to make new and confusing things more understandable and relatable by correlating it to things that we already know.
  I also found it very interesting how the author viewed a blank window as his artspace, similar to how a painter would view a canvas as theris. I think that this concept is very important to understand when realizing that internet art and websites are a new, emerging, and diverse form of art.
  I also did not know that augmented reality was a thing back in 2017 when this article was written. I had always assumed that it was a newer concept that deals with virtual reality headsets with built in cameras. However I am now wondering if there is more to augmented reality than that as it seems like it was an established art form already. I wonder if Pokemon Go or Snapchat filters are a type of augmented reality. I am now curious to research what are more common examples of augmented reality.
