<h1>8 Windows</h1>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="1.jpg" alt="Sideways view of a brick buildingâ€™s window" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>The world can always be seen differently from every perspective. When lying down in bed, this particular dorm window appears to be the letter T, separating the window into three distinct sections. The top section shows Elsworth, the left shows the bottom 4 floors of Werth, and the top shows the top 4 floors of Werth. Each section is made up of very different people.
</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="2.jpg" alt="Window of a restaurant table
" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>This window shows the combination of two different worlds. On one side is a couple having a nice Valentine's dinner. The other has cars racing home from a long day of work.
</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="3.jpg" alt="Rainy football field" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>While students study in a calming lounge, outside there is a violent rainstorm soaking the field.</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="4.jpg" alt="Looking downward on a construction area" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>This window shows a moment in time where a certain building on UConn campus is not finished with its construction yet. In the future this window will have a much different view than this.

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="5.jpg" alt="View of kids playing on a track" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>When it is not raining outside, lots of students love to go out to the field. You can see all the different kids playing many different games, showing all of their individuality.
</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="6.png" alt="View outside of a moving car" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>This window shows the world from a very different perspective. When looking at this car window, no view is ever the same, it is constantly changing.

</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="7.jpg" alt="View into a parking lot
" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>This window shows a staircase leading from the basement of the digital media design building into the parking lot outside of John Buckley residence hall.

</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div> <img src="8.jpg" alt="Screen window" width="500" height="600"> </div>
</div>

<p>This window is not as clear to see as others because it has a screen on it. This shows how everybody views the world differently.
